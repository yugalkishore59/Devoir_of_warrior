# Introduction
This summer, I had a chance to be part of Google Summer of Code 2022 and work with the International Catrobat Association. I worked on the Awesome Demo Game Project with Yash Punia as my mentor. My project had to create a complete game using Pocket Code, i.e., in the Catrobat visual programming language. This game, Devoir of Warrior, is playable on both a smartphone and a smart TV when cast from the phone.

Devoir of Warrior is heavily influenced by a very popular game Wizard of Legend. The game is themed on pixel art. This also includes camera movements and joystick inputs. The whole game story, almost every piece of art, and all the coding were done by me alone. The sounds and music in this game are all under creative common licence with proper attribution.

The game is complete and every asset used in this project is provided in this repository. Hence, this 175-hour-long Awesome Demo Game Project accomplished its goal by creating a fully-fledged game on the Pocket Code/Luna&Cat IDE app.
