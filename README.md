# Summary
This summer, I had a chance to be part of Google Summer of Code 2022 and work with the International Catrobat Association. I worked on the Awesome Demo Game Project with Yash Punia as my mentor. My project had to create a complete game using Pocket Code, i.e., in the Catrobat visual programming language. This game, Devoir of Warrior, is playable on both a smartphone and a smart TV when cast from the phone.

Devoir of Warrior is heavily influenced by a very popular game Wizard of Legend. The game is themed on pixel art. This incorporates camera motions as well as joystick inputs. The whole game story, almost every piece of art, and all the coding were done by me alone. The sounds and music in this game are all under creative common licence with proper attribution provided. There were situations when I encountered problems and things did not go as planned. Thanks to my mentor who helped me and we were able to work out solutions.

The game is complete and every asset used in this project is provided in this repository. Hence, this 175-hour-long Awesome Demo Game Project accomplished its goal by creating a fully-fledged game on the Pocket Code/Luna&Cat IDE app.

# About the Game
Devoir of Warrior is a fast-paced dungeon crawler game with puzzle solving elements. Packed with plenty of action and magical stuff, Devoir of Warrior provides a fluid and lag-free experience. You'll have to be quick on the battle field as there is no time to waste.

Devoir of Warrior tells the story of a brave warrior known as Farlus, on a quest to find and destroy an unknown evil reason behind the lost rains. Along this journey, you will have to explore various dungeons, solve the puzzles, and defeat the enemies. This game has some really strong and badass Boss fights which makes this game even more challenging. Along the route, you'll also come across a lot of Wizard's taverns, which are proper save points where you can upgrade your stats, purchase and select from a variety of magical attacks and save your progress. This gives you the flexibility to enjoy the game in your own playing style.
