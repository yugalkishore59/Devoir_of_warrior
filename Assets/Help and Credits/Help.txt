Devoir of Warrior is a fast-paced action game that
includes puzzle solving elements. There is no time
to waste during a fight. Quick movements and
variety of magical attacks make it so engaging.
Every dungeon is a different challenge and has a
Boss. However, there will be a puzzle for you to
solve before going into each Boss chamber. Along
the route, you'll also come across a lot of Wizard's
taverns where you can increase your stats, buy
magical attacks, and save your progress along the
voyage.

This is the first dungeon you will enter. Covered
with sand and deadly creatures, Wasteland of
Nadolin is a hot and dry place. It is guarded by
Oris. Your goal is to find and defeat Oris.

Full of ghosts, nightwalkers and skeletons etc,
The Nightfall G rave is indeed a scary place.
Your goal is to find magical stones that opens the
way to the Boss, Scuris.

Deep beneath the earth, Gloomy Cave is the home for
many hideous and poisnous creatures. The location
is held together by a magical spell. Your goal is
to set all of the magical stones in their right
locations. But remember, picking them starts a
countdown for the destruction of the cave.

Basalt Hill is an active volcano inhabited by a slew
of bizarre and unseen monsters capable of turning
anything into ash in the blink of an eye. The way is
not straightforward. Pulling a lever might open one
way but close the other.

Ukar's Hold, located on the summit of Basalt Hill,
is the stronghold of the toughest Boss, Ukar. It is
patrolled by his formidable guards. The place itself
is very confusing. Your goal is to find and defeat
Ukar by exploring the dungeon by teleporting through
teleporters.
