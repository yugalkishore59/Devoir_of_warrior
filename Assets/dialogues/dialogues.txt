Good day, visitor!  Welcome to the Wizard's Tavern.
I'm selling some freshly brewed potions.

So you're on the hunt for the evil behind this
catastrophe. You are a brave man, but the path ahead
is dangerous. I can provide you with some magical
potions which will grant you magical abilities. But
everything comes at a cost.

[farlus]
I have some gold. Take as much as you want, old man.

[wizard]
Given the circumstances, gold will not keep me
alive, but water will. Do you have water?

[farlus]
Yes, I do have some water.

[wizard]
Very well then! Here are your potions. You should
look around if you want anything else.

[farlus]
Ah! The door is locked. What is it on the door?
It appears to be a puzzle.

[farlus]
The door is open now.

[oris] [scuris] [kindra] [salb]
Who daresÂ barge in? Prepare to die.

[oris]
Noooooo! How can this be happening?

[farlus]
Who is responsible for this disaster?
Take me to your master.

[oris]
I failed you, Lord Ukar! Please forgive me.

[farlus]
So Ukar it is. Now at least I know his name.

[falus]
You are no match for me.
Now take me to Ukar, your lord.

[Scuris]
You will never find him. The path is guarded by
much stronger Lord Ukar's servants.

[farlus]
They will all meet the same fate.

[Slab]
I let you down, Lord Ukar!

[farlus]
Where is he hiding behind weaklings like you?

[slab]
On the summit of Basalt Hill, he is in his mansion.

[farlus]
It looks like I am close.

[Kindra]
You are stronger than me, but you don't stand a
chance against Lord Ukar.

He becomes stronger as he absorbs water from
anything. He will absorb water right out of your
body.

You'll suffer a painful demise!

[farlus]
This doesn't scare me at all.

[ukar]
Oh, my goodness! Look what we have here.
A mere human! I will smash you like a bug!

This can't be....! I...I am the strongest.

I am going to rule this world. I can't die!

[farlus]
Everything has an end. And today is yours.

Now that evil is gone, I should head back to
Nadolin.

[Farlus]
Where am I?
I should find the way out.

Ah! The way is blocked! What are those three
hollow sections on the gate? I need to find
something that fits in.

Now this should clear the way.

Not again!
I think they need to go somewhere.

Wait, what is happening? I should place the
stone before everything crumbles.

That's the last one. Let's go back.

It's quite hot up here.

The platform is not in place.
This is not natural. There must be something
that caused this.

So this is Ukar's big place.
This could be tricky.
