Good day, visitor!  Welcome to the Wizard's Tavern.
I'm selling some freshly brewed potions.

So you're on the hunt for the evil behind this
catastrophe. You are a brave man, but the path ahead
is dangerous. I can provide you with some magical
potions which will grant you magical abilities. But
everything comes at a cost.

[farlus]
I have some gold. Take as much as you want, old man.

[wizard]
Given the circumstances, gold will not keep me
alive, but water will. Do you have water?

[farlus]
Yes, I do have some water.

[wizard]
Very well then! Here are your potions. You should
look around if you want anything else.

[farlus]
Ah! The door is locked. What is it on the door?
It appears to be a puzzle.

[farlus]
The door is open now.

[oris]
Who daresÂ barge in? Prepare to die.

[oris]
Noooooo! How can this be happening?

[farlus]
Who is responsible for this disaster?
Take me to your master.

[oris]
I failed you, Lord Ukar! Please forgive me.

[farlus]
So Ukar it is. Now at least I know his name.
