Good day, visitor!  Welcome to the Wizard's Tavern.
I'm selling some freshly brewed potions.

So you're on the hunt for the evil behind this
catastrophe. You are a brave man, but the path ahead
is dangerous. I can provide you with some magical
potions which will grant you magical abilities. But
everything comes at a cost.

[farlus]
I have some gold. Take as much as you want, old man.

[wizard]
Given the circumstances, gold will not keep me
alive, but water will. Do you have water?

[farlus]
Yes, I do have some water.

[wizard]
Very well then! Here are your potions. You should
look around if you want to buy more.
